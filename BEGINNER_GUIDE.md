# Medical Device Log Chatbot - Beginner's Guide

## ü§ñ What is this project?

Imagine you have thousands of medical devices (like heart monitors, ventilators, etc.) in a hospital, and each device creates logs (like a diary entry) every time something happens - when it starts up, when it detects an issue, when it connects to the network, etc.

This project is like a **smart assistant** that can help you find and understand these logs in two ways:

1. **Ask questions in plain English** - "What errors happened yesterday?" or "Show me all devices in the ICU"
2. **Use specific commands** - "List all device IDs and their current status"

Think of it like having a very smart librarian who can either understand your natural questions OR follow your specific instructions to find exactly what you need.

## üë• Who is this for?

### Primary Users
- **Hospital IT Staff** - People who need to monitor and troubleshoot medical devices
- **Biomedical Engineers** - Technical staff who maintain medical equipment
- **Hospital Administrators** - Managers who need reports on device status

### Secondary Users
- **Product Managers** - People who need to understand system performance
- **Quality Assurance Teams** - Staff who monitor device reliability
- **Support Teams** - People who help troubleshoot device issues

## üîÑ How does it work? (The Simple Version)

### The Big Picture
```
User asks a question ‚Üí System decides how to answer ‚Üí Gets the answer ‚Üí Shows results
```

### Step-by-Step Breakdown

#### Step 1: You Ask a Question
You type something like: "What errors occurred yesterday?" or "List all devices in Ward 5"

#### Step 2: The System Decides How to Answer
The system looks at your question and thinks:
- "Is this a specific request for exact data?" ‚Üí Use direct database search
- "Is this a general question?" ‚Üí Use AI-powered search

#### Step 3: Getting the Answer
**Option A - Direct Search** (like using a filing cabinet):
- Goes directly to the database
- Finds exact matches
- Returns specific data

**Option B - AI Search** (like asking a smart assistant):
- Converts your question into a "fingerprint" (called an embedding)
- Finds similar logs in the database
- Uses AI to generate a helpful answer

#### Step 4: Showing Results
- **Direct searches**: Shows data in neat tables
- **AI searches**: Gives you a natural language answer

## üèóÔ∏è Why did we build it this way?

### The Problem We Solved
Medical device logs are like having thousands of diary entries in different languages and formats. Traditional search tools are like trying to find a specific sentence in a library where books are scattered everywhere.

### Our Solution
We created a **hybrid system** that combines the best of both worlds:

1. **Fast, Precise Search** - When you know exactly what you want
2. **Smart, Flexible Search** - When you want to explore or ask general questions

### Why This Approach?
- **Speed**: Direct searches are lightning-fast
- **Flexibility**: AI can understand natural language
- **Accuracy**: You get exactly what you need
- **User-Friendly**: Works for both technical and non-technical users

## üìö Key Terms Explained (In Plain English)

### Technical Terms Made Simple

| Term | What It Means | Real-World Analogy |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| **RAG** | Retrieval-Augmented Generation | Like having a smart assistant who can look up information and then explain it to you |
| **Embedding** | A way to convert text into numbers that represent meaning | Like creating a fingerprint for each piece of text |
| **Vector Search** | Finding similar items by comparing their "fingerprints" | Like finding similar songs by comparing their musical patterns |
| **MongoDB** | A database that stores information in flexible documents | Like a digital filing cabinet that can store any type of information |
| **Ollama** | A tool that runs AI models on your own computer | Like having a smart assistant that lives on your computer instead of the internet |
| **API** | A way for different programs to talk to each other | Like a waiter who takes your order to the kitchen and brings back your food |
| **Endpoint** | A specific address where you can ask for information | Like a specific phone number for a specific department |

### Project-Specific Terms

| Term | What It Means | Example |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **Device Log** | A record of something that happened with a medical device | "Device ABC123 started up at 9:00 AM" |
| **Field Alias** | A shortcut name for a longer field name | Using "deviceid" instead of "DeviceId" |
| **Query** | A question or request for information | "Show me all devices in the ICU" |
| **Filter** | A way to narrow down results | "Only show devices from yesterday" |
| **Context** | The background information given to the AI | "Here are 15 relevant logs, now answer the question" |

## üì¶ NPM Packages (The Building Blocks)

Think of NPM packages like **pre-built tools** that we use instead of building everything from scratch.

### Core Packages We Use

| Package | What It Does | Why We Use It | Real-World Analogy |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **mongodb** | Connects to and talks to our database | To store and retrieve medical device logs | Like a translator that helps us talk to our filing cabinet |
| **axios** | Makes requests to other services | To ask the AI system for help | Like a messenger that carries our questions to the AI assistant |
| **dotenv** | Manages secret information | To keep passwords and connection details safe | Like a secure vault for our keys and passwords |
| **readline-sync** | Handles user input in the terminal | To let users type questions and see answers | Like a receptionist who takes your questions and shows you the answers |

### Optional Packages

| Package | What It Does | Why We Use It | Real-World Analogy |
|---------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| **cli-table3** | Makes nice-looking tables in the terminal | To display results in an organized way | Like a formatter that makes reports look professional |

## üöÄ How to Set Up and Run (For Beginners)

### What You Need
- A computer (Windows, Mac, or Linux)
- Basic computer skills (like installing software)
- About 30 minutes of time

### Step-by-Step Setup

#### Step 1: Install Required Software
Think of this like installing apps on your phone - you need the right apps to make everything work.

**Install Node.js** (This is like the engine that runs our program):
1. Go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Download the "LTS" version (it's more stable)
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions

**Install Ollama** (This is our AI assistant):
1. Go to [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
2. Download the version for your computer
3. Install it like any other program

#### Step 2: Get the Project Files
1. Download the project files (like downloading a folder)
2. Put them in a folder on your computer
3. Open a terminal/command prompt in that folder

#### Step 3: Install the Building Blocks
In your terminal, type:
```bash
npm install
```
This is like telling the computer: "Get all the tools we need for this project"

#### Step 4: Set Up the AI Models
In your terminal, type:
```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
ollama pull mistral
```
This is like downloading the "brains" for our AI assistant

#### Step 5: Set Up the Database
You need a place to store the medical device logs. You have two options:

**Option A: Use MongoDB Atlas (Recommended for beginners)**
1. Go to [mongodb.com](https://mongodb.com)
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new database
4. Get your connection string (like an address for your database)

**Option B: Install MongoDB locally**
1. Download MongoDB from [mongodb.com](https://mongodb.com)
2. Install it on your computer
3. Start the MongoDB service

#### Step 6: Configure the Project
Create a file called `.env` in your project folder and add:
```
MONGO_URI=your_database_connection_string_here
```

#### Step 7: Run the Project
In your terminal, type:
```bash
node chatbot.js
```

You should see something like:
```
üí¨ Terminal RAG Chatbot (type 'exit' or 'q' to quit)

üß† You: 
```

Now you can type questions and get answers!
