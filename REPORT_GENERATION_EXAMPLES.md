# Medical Device Log Report Generation Examples

## üéØ Current Capabilities

Your RAG system can already answer questions like:

### Basic Queries (Already Working)
```bash
# Direct queries for specific data
"list deviceid and loglevel where organizationid=ABC"
"show logs for deviceid=ABC123"

# Natural language queries
"What alerts were generated last week?"
"How many devices are in the ICU?"
"What errors occurred yesterday?"
```

## üìä Enhanced Report Generation Possibilities

### 1. **Alert Summary Reports**
```bash
# User asks:
"Generate a weekly report for organization ABC showing:
- Total alerts generated
- Total HR values uploaded  
- Total alerts acknowledged
- Device status summary"

# System would:
1. Query logs for organization ABC
2. Filter by date range (last week)
3. Count different alert types
4. Aggregate HR data uploads
5. Count acknowledged alerts
6. Generate formatted report
```

### 2. **Device Performance Reports**
```bash
# User asks:
"Create a monthly report showing:
- Device uptime percentages
- Error rates by device type
- Ward-wise device distribution
- Critical alert trends"

# System would:
1. Analyze device states over time
2. Calculate uptime percentages
3. Group errors by device type
4. Count devices by ward
5. Identify alert patterns
6. Present findings in report format
```

### 3. **Operational Health Reports**
```bash
# User asks:
"Generate a daily operational report for ICU ward:
- Active devices count
- Connection status summary
- Alert response times
- Data upload statistics"

# System would:
1. Filter logs for ICU ward
2. Count active devices
3. Analyze connection states
4. Calculate response times
5. Summarize data uploads
6. Format as daily report
```

## üîß Implementation Approach

### Current System Enhancement

#### 1. **Enhanced Query Processing**
```javascript
// Add report-specific query patterns
function isReportQuery(query) {
  return /generate.*report|create.*report|weekly.*report|monthly.*report/i.test(query);
}

// Parse report requirements
function parseReportRequirements(query) {
  const requirements = {
    organization: extractOrganization(query),
    timeRange: extractTimeRange(query),
    metrics: extractMetrics(query),
    format: determineReportFormat(query)
  };
  return requirements;
}
```

#### 2. **Report Generation Engine**
```javascript
async function generateReport(requirements) {
  // 1. Gather data based on requirements
  const data = await gatherReportData(requirements);
  
  // 2. Process and aggregate data
  const processedData = await processReportData(data, requirements);
  
  // 3. Generate report using AI
  const report = await generateReportWithAI(processedData, requirements);
  
  // 4. Format and return
  return formatReport(report, requirements.format);
}
```

#### 3. **Data Aggregation Functions**
```javascript
async function gatherReportData(requirements) {
  const { organization, timeRange, metrics } = requirements;
  
  // Build MongoDB aggregation pipeline
  const pipeline = [
    { $match: { 
      OrganizationId: organization,
      Timestamp: { $gte: timeRange.start, $lte: timeRange.end }
    }},
    { $group: {
      _id: null,
      totalAlerts: { $sum: { $cond: [{ $eq: ["$LogLevel", "ALERT"] }, 1, 0] }},
      totalHRUploads: { $sum: { $cond: [{ $regexMatch: { input: "$LogSummary", regex: "HR.*upload" }}, 1, 0] }},
      totalAcknowledged: { $sum: { $cond: [{ $eq: ["$LogData.State", "ACKNOWLEDGED"] }, 1, 0] }},
      deviceCount: { $addToSet: "$DeviceId" }
    }},
    { $project: {
      totalAlerts: 1,
      totalHRUploads: 1,
      totalAcknowledged: 1,
      uniqueDevices: { $size: "$deviceCount" }
    }}
  ];
  
  return await collection.aggregate(pipeline).toArray();
}
```

#### 4. **AI-Powered Report Generation**
```javascript
async function generateReportWithAI(data, requirements) {
  const context = `
    Organization: ${requirements.organization}
    Time Period: ${requirements.timeRange.start} to ${requirements.timeRange.end}
    
    Data Summary:
    - Total Alerts: ${data[0].totalAlerts}
    - HR Values Uploaded: ${data[0].totalHRUploads}
    - Alerts Acknowledged: ${data[0].totalAcknowledged}
    - Active Devices: ${data[0].uniqueDevices}
  `;
  
  const prompt = `
    You are a medical device operations analyst. Generate a professional report based on the following data:
    
    ${context}
    
    Requirements: ${requirements.metrics.join(', ')}
    
    Please create a well-structured report that includes:
    1. Executive Summary
    2. Key Metrics
    3. Trends and Insights
    4. Recommendations
  `;
  
  return await askMistral(context, prompt);
}
```

## üìã Example Report Output

### Weekly Report for Organization ABC
```
üìä WEEKLY OPERATIONS REPORT
Organization: ABC
Period: January 8-14, 2024

üìà EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
- Total Alerts Generated: 47
- HR Values Uploaded: 1,234
- Alerts Acknowledged: 42 (89.4% response rate)
- Active Devices: 23

üîç KEY METRICS
‚Ä¢ Alert Response Rate: 89.4% (above target of 85%)
‚Ä¢ Average Daily HR Uploads: 176
‚Ä¢ Device Uptime: 98.7%
‚Ä¢ Critical Alerts: 3 (all resolved within SLA)

üìä TRENDS & INSIGHTS
‚Ä¢ Alert volume increased 15% from previous week
‚Ä¢ ICU devices showed highest alert frequency
‚Ä¢ HR data uploads remained consistent

2. Consider additional monitoring for high-alert devices
3. Maintain current response time improvements
4. Schedule preventive maintenance for devices with frequent alerts
```

## üöÄ Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Basic Report Queries (Current)
```bash
# These already work with your system:
"Show me all alerts for organization ABC from last week"
"Count total HR uploads for the past 7 days"
"List all acknowledged alerts for device ABC123"
```

### Phase 2: Enhanced Report Generation (Future)
```javascript
// Add to chatbot.js
async function handleReportQuery(query) {
  const requirements = parseReportRequirements(query);
  const data = await gatherReportData(requirements);
  const report = await generateReportWithAI(data, requirements);
  return formatReport(report);
}
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics (Future)
```javascript
// Add trend analysis
async function analyzeTrends(data, timeRange) {
  // Compare with previous periods
  // Identify patterns and anomalies
  // Generate predictive insights
}
```
