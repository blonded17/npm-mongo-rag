## 🎯 Project Overview

### What This System Does
Think of this as a **smart search engine** for medical device logs. Instead of having to know exactly what to search for, users can ask questions in plain English like "What errors happened yesterday?" and get intelligent answers.

### The Core Innovation
We built a **hybrid system** that combines:
- **Fast, precise searches** (like Google's exact search)
- **Smart, flexible AI** (like ChatGPT's understanding)

This gives users the best of both worlds - speed when they know exactly what they want, and intelligence when they want to explore or ask general questions.

## 📁 File Structure & Purpose

### Core Application Files

#### 1. `chatbot.js` - The Main Application
**What it does**: This is the "brain" of the entire system - the main application that users interact with.

**Think of it as**: The receptionist at a hospital who can either:
- Look up specific patient records (fast, direct search)
- Answer general questions about patients (smart, AI-powered search)

**Key Components Inside**:
```javascript
// Configuration - Like setting up the office
const MONGO_URI = process.env.MONGO_URI;  // Database address
const OLLAMA_URL = "http://localhost:11434";  // AI assistant location
const EMBEDDING_MODEL = "nomic-embed-text";  // Text understanding model
const CHAT_MODEL = "mistral";  // Conversation model
```

**Field Aliases System**:
```javascript
const FIELD_ALIASES = {
  deviceid: "DeviceId",  // Short name → Full name
  model: "LogData.Model",  // User-friendly → Technical name
  ward: "LogData.Ward",  // Simple → Complex path
  // ... 30+ more mappings
};
```
**Why this matters**: Users can type simple words like "deviceid" instead of the complex technical names like "DeviceId".

#### 2. `ingest-logs.js` - The Data Processor
**What it does**: Takes raw medical device logs and prepares them for AI understanding by converting text into "fingerprints" (embeddings).

**Think of it as**: A librarian who reads every book in the library and creates a smart index that can find similar books.

**Key Process**:
1. **Find unprocessed logs** - Look for logs that haven't been "fingerprinted" yet
2. **Extract meaningful text** - Combine important parts of each log
3. **Generate embeddings** - Convert text into numerical "fingerprints"
4. **Store in database** - Save the fingerprints for fast searching

**Example of text extraction**:
```javascript
// Before: Complex log with many fields
{
  DeviceId: "ABC123",
  LogSummary: "Connection error",
  LogData: { State: "ERROR", Ward: "ICU" }
}

// After: Simple text for AI to understand
"DeviceId: ABC123 | Connection error | ERROR | ICU"
```

#### 3. `package.json` - The Shopping List
**What it does**: Lists all the external tools and libraries the project needs to work.

**Think of it as**: A shopping list for building a house - you need bricks, cement, tools, etc.

**Key Dependencies**:
```json
{
  "mongodb": "^6.17.0",        // Database connector
  "axios": "^1.10.0",          // Internet messenger
  "dotenv": "^17.2.0",         // Secret keeper
  "readline-sync": "^1.4.10"   // User input handler
}
```

#### 4. `.env` - The Secret Keeper
**What it does**: Stores sensitive information like database passwords and connection strings.

**Think of it as**: A secure vault for your house keys and passwords.

**Example**:
```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/logs
```

#### 5. `.gitignore` - The Privacy Filter
**What it does**: Tells the system what files NOT to share publicly (like passwords, temporary files).

**Think of it as**: A privacy filter that prevents sharing sensitive information.

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture Deep Dive

### The Three-Layer Architecture

#### Layer 1: User Interface (What Users See)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│           Terminal CLI              │
│  (The chat interface users type in) │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What happens here**:
- Users type questions or commands
- System displays answers in tables or natural language
- Handles user input and output formatting

#### Layer 2: Business Logic (The Decision Maker)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│        Query Parser & Router        │
│  (Decides how to answer each query) │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What happens here**:
- Analyzes what the user is asking for
- Decides whether to use fast search or AI search
- Routes the request to the right handler

#### Layer 3: Data & AI Services (The Heavy Lifters)
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  MongoDB + Ollama + Vector Search  │
│     (Database + AI + Smart Search) │
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What happens here**:
- Stores and retrieves medical device logs
- Generates AI embeddings and responses
- Performs intelligent similarity searches

### How the Layers Work Together

#### Scenario 1: Direct Query
```
User: "list deviceid and model"
     ↓
Parser: "This is a structured request for specific data"
     ↓
Router: "Use fast database search"
     ↓
MongoDB: "Find DeviceId and Model fields"
     ↓
Result: "Table with DeviceId and Model columns"
```

#### Scenario 2: Natural Language Query
```
User: "What errors occurred yesterday?"
     ↓
Parser: "This is a general question needing AI understanding"
     ↓
Router: "Use AI-powered search"
     ↓
Ollama: "Convert question to numerical fingerprint"
     ↓
Vector Search: "Find similar logs in database"
     ↓
Mistral: "Generate natural language answer"
     ↓
Result: "Based on the logs, I found 3 errors yesterday..."
```

## 💼 Business Logic Explained

### The Smart Decision Engine

#### Query Classification Logic
The system uses **pattern matching** to understand what type of question you're asking:

```javascript
// Direct Query Patterns (Fast Search)
/^(list|show|find)\b/i  // "list deviceid"
/^list\s+unique\s+(.+)$/i  // "list unique deviceid"
/^show\s+(all\s+)?logs\b/i  // "show logs"

// Natural Language (AI Search)
// Everything else falls back to AI-powered search
```

**Business Value**: Users get the fastest possible response for structured queries, while still having the flexibility of AI for complex questions.

#### Field Alias System
Instead of requiring users to know complex technical field names, we provide simple shortcuts:

```javascript
// User types: "deviceid" → System uses: "DeviceId"
// User types: "model" → System uses: "LogData.Model"
// User types: "ward" → System uses: "LogData.Ward"
```

**Business Value**: Reduces training time and user errors, making the system more accessible to non-technical users.

#### Dual Search Strategy
We implemented two different search approaches for different use cases:

**Fast Search (Direct Queries)**:
- **When to use**: User knows exactly what they want
- **Speed**: 50-100ms response time
- **Example**: "Show me all devices in the ICU"
- **Output**: Structured table

**Smart Search (RAG Queries)**:
- **When to use**: User wants to explore or ask general questions
- **Speed**: 800-2000ms response time
- **Example**: "What problems are we having with ventilators?"
- **Output**: Natural language answer

**Business Value**: Optimizes user experience by providing the right tool for each type of question.

### Error Handling Strategy

#### Graceful Degradation
The system is designed to handle failures gracefully:

```javascript
// If database is down
"❌ Error: Cannot connect to database"

// If AI service is unavailable
"❌ Error: AI service not responding"

// If no results found
"🤖 No matching logs found."
```

**Business Value**: Users get helpful error messages instead of technical jargon, reducing support calls.
